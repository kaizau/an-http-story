# An HTTP Story 🧶

> A sub-13kb\* VR-enabled game about finding one's way.

Sometimes, the web can be a beautiful place. Other times, it can be a dangerous
place.

This story is about one of the latter times...

## Details 🔍

This is my entry for the 2020 js13KGames competition —
[WebXR](https://js13kgames.com/webxr) and [Web
Monetization](https://js13kgames.com/webmonetization) categories.

Given the use of experimental APIs, it's only intended for desktop and VR
browsers:

- Oculus Browser (Quest) - VR controls, but no speech synthesis
- Firefox 81+ - Keyboard and mouse
- Chrome 84+ - Keyboard and mouse

## Controls 🕹

### VR

**At least one input controller with a trigger required.** Standing or sitting,
no need for a large play area.

- Trigger to move Zyra to selected block
- Trigger (held down) to drag selected blue block

### Keyboard and Mouse

- Arrow keys to move the camera
- Click to move Zyra to selected block
- Click (and hold) to drag selected blue block

## Extra Levels 🍰

[Coil](https://coil.com/) members can create their own levels or load those
created by others!

A huge thank you to...

- [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) for the detailed documentation and
  absurdly useful code sandbox.
