# A HTTP Story 🧶

> A 13kb\* VR-enabled game about trust and finding one's way...

Sometimes, the web can be a beautiful place. Other times, it can be a dangerous
place.

This story is about one of the latter times...

## Details 🔍

This is my entry for the 2020 js13KGames competition, [WebXR
category](https://js13kgames.com/webxr).

Given the use of experimental WebXR APIs, it's only intended for modern
browsers:

- Oculus Browser (Quest) - VR controls, but no speech synthesis
- Firefox 81+ - Keyboard and mouse
- Chrome 84+ - Keyboard and mouse

## Controls 🕹

### VR

- Trigger to move Zyra to selected block
- Trigger (hold) to drag selected block
- Standing or sitting, no need for a large play area

### Keyboard and Mouse

- Arrow keys to move the camera
- Click to move Zyra to selected block
- Click (hold) to drag selected block

## Extra Levels 🍰

created by others!

## Credits 🙏

A huge thank you to...

- [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/) for the spark of inspiration.
- [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) for the framework, detailed
  documentation, and absurdly useful code sandbox.
- [SoundBox](https://sb.bitsnbites.eu/) for the tiny music player.
- [m@Bits'n'Bytes](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=64246) for the epic
  sountrack _Wilderness_.

And [the hard-working many](https://xkcd.com/2347/) who maintain all the open
technologies we take for granted.
